## Mess Menu app for CS50 Final Project
This is my submission for CS50's Final Project along the Web Track. I created this website with an intention to introduce an online interface for the Dining facility of my college.

## Tech Stack
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>SQLite3 (Later shifted to Postgres for deployment)</li>
<li>Flask</li>
</ul>

I also took help of CS50's IDE along with their modules for prelimanary development.
